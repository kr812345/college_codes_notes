    Aarti Shri Krishna Ki
    </h1>
    <dl>
    <dt>(Verse 1)</dt>
    <dd>
    Hail to Lord Krishna, the enchanting flutist,
    Whose divine melody echoes through creation.
    With eyes like lotus petals, radiant and deep,
    He captivates hearts in love's eternal sweep.
    </dd>
    <dt>
    (Chorus)
    <dt>
    <dd>    
    Jai Shri Krishna, Jai Shri Krishna,
    Victory to Lord Krishna, the source of bliss.
    Jai Shri Krishna, Jai Shri Krishna,
    In devotion, we revel in your divine kiss.
    </dd>
    
    <dt>(Verse 2)</dt>
    <dd>
    Adorned with peacock feathers, the symbol of grace,
    Krishna, the cowherd, in every heart finds a place.
    His playful charm and mischievous smile,
    Guide us through life's journey, mile by mile.
    </dd>
    <dt>
    (Chorus)
    </dt>
    <dd>
    Jai Shri Krishna, Jai Shri Krishna,
    In your cosmic dance, the universe spins.
    Jai Shri Krishna, Jai Shri Krishna,
    In devotion's flame, our love begins.
    </dd>
    <dt>
    (Verse 3)
    </dt>
    <dd>
    Bearer of the Sudarshan Chakra, mighty and bright,
    Protector of dharma, dispelling the night.
    In the Bhagavad Gita, your wisdom unfolds,
    A timeless scripture, as the epic tale molds.
    </dd>
    <dt>
    (Chorus)
    </dt>
    <dd>
    Jai Shri Krishna, Jai Shri Krishna,
    In your divine presence, our souls take flight.
    Jai Shri Krishna, Jai Shri Krishna,
    Guiding us from darkness to eternal light.
    </dd>
    <dt>
    (Verse 4)
    <dd>
    As we offer this aarti with love so pure,
    May your blessings in our hearts endure.
    Jai Shri Krishna, the Supreme Being,
    In devotion, our souls find eternal meaning.
    </dd>
    <dt>
    (Chorus)
    <dd>
    Jai Shri Krishna, Jai Shri Krishna,
    With each flicker, our faith ignites.
    Jai Shri Krishna, Jai Shri Krishna,
    In your love, the universe unites.
